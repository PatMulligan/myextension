# MyExtension - An [LNbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits) Extension

## A Starter Template for Your Own Extension

Ready to start hacking? Once you've forked this extension, you can incorporate functions from other extensions as needed.

### How to Use This Template

> This guide assumes you're using this extension as a base for a new one, and have installed LNbits using https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/blob/main/docs/guide/installation.md#option-1-recommended-poetry.

* Stop LNbits
* Clone this extension into the extension folder
* Make your changes to models.py/migration.py (if you run without making your chnages it will build the db and you will likely have to delete later - no biggie, but making the chnages first helps)
* Hack about building your awesome new extension. Start/stop LNbits as ou are hacking.
* Share. Profit. Innovate. Win! 

IMPORTANT: If you want your extension to be added to the official LNbits manifest, please follow the guidelines here: https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-extensions#important
